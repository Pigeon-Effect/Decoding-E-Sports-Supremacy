# **Decoding E-Sports Supremacy**

This project investigates the dynamics of competitive dominance in e-sports, focusing on how various factors influence player and team performance across major titles. Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization, it aims to uncover patterns behind sustained success in e-sports ecosystems.

---

## **Overview**

E-sports has rapidly evolved into a global competitive phenomenon. Understanding what drives supremacy—be it player skill, team strategies, or meta-game shifts—is key for analysts, coaches, and enthusiasts alike.

This repository offers:

- Data collection and preprocessing pipelines  
- Statistical analyses of player/team performance metrics  
- Visualizations highlighting key trends and turning points  
- Reproducible code for further experimentation

---

## **Data Sources**

The datasets are compiled from public APIs, tournament results, and player statistics across multiple popular e-sports titles (e.g., League of Legends, Dota 2, CS:GO).

Preprocessing scripts handle data cleaning, normalization, and aggregation to enable meaningful cross-title comparisons.

## **Key Features**

- **Performance Metrics:** Computation of advanced stats such as kill/death ratios, win rates, and consistency scores.  
- **Temporal Analysis:** Tracking changes in dominance over seasons or patches.  
- **Comparative Visualizations:** Interactive charts and heatmaps illustrating supremacy patterns.  
- **Open-Source Tools:** Written primarily in Python using libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
